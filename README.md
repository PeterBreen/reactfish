#Reactfish

It's a fishtank, built in React! You can watch and ... sort of interact with a dopefish. Reactfish was originally built from the Codecademy React scaffolding, but was rebuilt in the Create React App and ES2015 syntax.

##Instructions
Follow the Create React App deployment instructions: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app  

Assuming you run `npm start` and then navigate to `localhost:3000`, watch fish swim around - much like a real fishtank. You can click on a specific fish and it will pause, burp, and then continue swimming around the tank.


##What the heck is a dopefish?
Dopefish is an enemy from Commander Keen IV: Keen Dreams. For more information than you ever wanted to know, please see http://www.dopefish.com/. It's a fish who likes to swim and eat. Sometimes it burps. And that's about it.
