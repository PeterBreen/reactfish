#Reactfish

It's a fishtank, built in React! You can watch and ... sort of interact with a dopefish. Reactfish was originally built from the Codecademy React scaffolding, but was rebuilt in the Create React App and ES2015 syntax.




##What the heck is a dopefish?
Dopefish is an enemy from Commander Keen IV: Keen Dreams. For more information than you ever wanted to know, please see http://www.dopefish.com/. It's a fish who likes to swim and eat. Sometimes it burps. And that's about it.
